# Assumptions
Set by the case study:
- Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders
- Leadership believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth

My assumptions:
- Due to data-privacy issues, the public data used for this project does not contain any riders' personally identifiable information, so we have to make many assumptions based on individual trip records based on trip time and user type (casual or member)
- Most users are local to the Chicago area and use the service fairly regularly
- Annual members use the servcie for commuting to work
- Casual riders use the service for recreational use, it's likely this is most frequently on weekends
- Single-ride and full-day passes are generally cheaper than an annual membership, but there is a certain frequency of use where the annual membership is the better deal for users while still being the most profitable offering for the company

*No financial information or customer/user information is made available for this case study, so many general assumptions were made in the process of completing this project.*
